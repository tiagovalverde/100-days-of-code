# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created the HTML?CSS skeleton of the page, Random article link and search bar with the enter keyboard event active.

**Thoughts:** I tried to find a very cool search bar animation for my project but I felt I was just copying and pasting code so I decided to keep the original search bar and later on I will customize progressively.
