# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created the HTML?CSS skeleton of the page, Random article link and search bar with the enter keyboard event active.

**Thoughts:** I tried to find a very cool search bar animation for my project but I felt I was just copying and pasting code so I decided to keep the original search bar and later on I will customize progressively.

### Day 1: July 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Last CSS fixes related to mobile responsiveness and size of the paragraph element on blog pages.

**Thoughts:** Despite my website is up and running, I always found myself making small changes in the CSS to correct little things that bother me. I think tomorow I will submit my first blog post.

### Day 2: July 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Wikipidea API request and JSON response through JS and jQuery. Able to list the first 10 results of the query with the respective title, summary and link to the wikipedia page of the article.

**Thoughts:** I got the feeling tha the wikipedia page is too complex and has an enourmous number of options. Getting the exact date we need is tricky.

### Day 3: July 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Corrected mostly responsiveness issues and defined the colors of the web app.

**Thoughts:** Choosing the color scheme for a web app is always a hard for me. I feel I do not have the sensisivity to choose the right colors. Project is almost done. My last challenge will be trying to add images to the search results.

### Day 4: July 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started my TwitchTV, another FreeCodeCamp Project. Simply read the requirements and setup a raw HTML CSS to work with.

**Thoughts:** My goal is to do a webapp with a responsive grid instead of a list of channels as shown in the example in order to be a little different and not just reverse engineer the layout.

### Day 5: July 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started setting up requests using the twitch API to obtain the user's name, logo and status.

**Thoughts:** FreeCodeCamp provides a simple workaround to avoid using the Client-ID for Kraken API calls. Also, today was a long day and did not coded as much as I wanted.

### Day 6: July 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Able to get all necessary data from the Twitch API and populate it.

**Thoughts:** Finding a workaround to obtain the data sequentially was challenging. I still get confused with variable scopes.

### Day 7: July 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Add links to the Twitch users online and CSS layout changes.

**Thoughts:** The hard part of the project is done. Mostly what I have to do is positioning the data, add color scheme and effects/animations. Able to program only one hour today.

### Day 8: July 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished up TwitchTV project

**Thoughts:** Finished faster than I thouhth. However, I choosed to not implment some extra features I was thinking. I rather jump to the next freecodecamp project to reach my goal.

### Day 9: July 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the JavaScript Calculator

**Thoughts:** Only able to create the pen and create basic HTML/CSS.

### Day 10: July 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Calculator design. Playing with shadows, 3d effects on buttons and colors.

**Thoughts:** I actually had an idea that building the calculator layout was going to be time consiuming but I did better than expected. Never create expectations, just go for it.

### Day 11: July 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Calculator design. Screen shadow, zero and equal button design. Jquery on click events.

**Thoughts:** I am wondering if i use only on button on click event and deal with logic in a sequence of conditions calling externar smaller functions do execute the logic or a cick event for every button.

### Day 12: July 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Printing to the calculator screen and logic of recognizing the type of button clicked.

**Thoughts:** Today was more about thinking than coding. Had to go back to the basics and create a fluxogram of decision making.

### Day 13: July 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Migrated the project to Github and created the functions for each type of button (digit, dot and clear).

**Thoughts:** After reading Danny Huang's [article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/got-a-react-developer-job-during-my-100dayscodechallenge-f455175d3776) on Medium I decided to start Github while developing my projects. I took the free Udacity course on Git & Github 2 months ago but didnt took it seriously because codepen offers simplicity. This way I will be able to work offline more often, will keep track of my progress and will be more careful writing my code.

### Day 14: July 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Calculator screen - result and history fields interaction with the buttons.

**Thoughts:** Today was a slow process and a little bit confusing. Had to go through all the possible states of the calculator screen and the data shown. A lot of conditions to cover in order to provide a smooth user experience.

### Day 15: July 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Button CE functionality finished, arithmetic operation using eval, mobile full screen background image fixed, code cleanup. JS Calculator project finished (6 hours)

**Thoughts:** Experienced the real potential of the function eval() in Javascript. I was initially worried about the time I was going to spend converting the string to an aithemtic operation but with eval() took me one line off code.

### Day 16: July 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Bugs fixes after others campers feedback. However, decided to limit size of an input to 9 digits and the arithmetic chain of 22 characters. If than limits are exceeded no result is printed. (1 hours)

**Thoughts:** I realized that making artihemtic operations to the console.log() versus to the sceen is a lot different. Thanks to the feedback of other campers I found some bugs and fix it. My user experience off an application is always seen differently from others.

### Day 17: July 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started a Pomodoro Clock Project for FreeCodeCamp.(3 hours)

**Thoughts:** I am curious to find out a way to implement a timer effect and I am planning to finish this project by August 6, 2017.

### Day 18: August 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tested different range sliders to use as time setup for Pomodoro Clock.(1 hours)

**Thoughts:** I tried to use a jQuery mobile range slider which looke awseome, but CSS conflicts between jQuery mobile and Boostrap made me give a step back and go with a simpler solution.

### Day 19: August 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Implemented range slider to be used to setup the timer.(1 hours)

**Thoughts:** Sometimes it is better too look for simple solutions and adapt to your project the way you want it instead of using a full library.

### Day 22: August 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Sync countdown timer with circle bar effect (2 hour)

**Thoughts:** Today I got stuck on the manipulation of animations of svg. Spent most of the time trying to solve a problem which I didnt find yet. However, I found a the library progressbar.js and tomorrow I will give it another try.

### Day 24: August 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Pomodoro Clock Finished - Responsive layout, color scheme and finished (3.5 hours)

**Thoughts:** I am starting to design the layout and apply the color schemes way faster compared when I first started the freecodecamp projects. Now the challenge is in coding Javascript more organized. Might start reading the book JS Design Patterns.

**Today's Progress**: Started the JavaScript30 course and completed the first micro project (1 hour)

**Thoughts:** Obtain a better understading of CSS transitions and got to work with HTML element using pure JS, not jQuery. Skipped 10 days of the #100DaysofCode challenge because I am currently on vacations. I am been trying to compensate the lack of coding by reading YDKJS as much as I can. I am thinking in starting the challenging from day 0 when I come back to Toronto.

**Thoughts:** Really loving the Javascript30 course by Wes Bos. I have been doing the FCC course only reading and googling for solutions around, but having someone explaining and coding at the same time it really helps to understand how certain things are done. Definetly start to approach different types of learning in the future.
