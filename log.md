# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created the HTML?CSS skeleton of the page, Random article link and search bar with the enter keyboard event active.

**Thoughts:** I tried to find a very cool search bar animation for my project but I felt I was just copying and pasting code so I decided to keep the original search bar and later on I will customize progressively.

### Day 1: July 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Last CSS fixes related to mobile responsiveness and size of the paragraph element on blog pages.

**Thoughts:** Despite my website is up and running, I always found myself making small changes in the CSS to correct little things that bother me. I think tomorow I will submit my first blog post.

### Day 2: July 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Wikipidea API request and JSON response through JS and jQuery. Able to list the first 10 results of the query with the respective title, summary and link to the wikipedia page of the article.

**Thoughts:** I got the feeling tha the wikipedia page is too complex and has an enourmous number of options. Getting the exact date we need is tricky.

### Day 3: July 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Corrected mostly responsiveness issues and defined the colors of the web app.

**Thoughts:** Choosing the color scheme for a web app is always a hard for me. I feel I do not have the sensisivity to choose the right colors. Project is almost done. My last challenge will be trying to add images to the search results.
